      "content": "Level of Detail (LOD) is crucial for game performance. In this post, I'll share my workflow for creating LOD chains that maintain visual fidelity while optimizing for real-time rendering.\n\n## Why LODs Matter\n\nWhen rendering a scene with hundreds of props, each polygon counts. LODs allow the engine to swap high-detail models for simpler versions as objects move further from the camera.\n\n## My LOD Workflow\n\n1. Start with the highest detail - Create your hero model with all the details you need for close-up shots.\n2. Use decimation wisely - Tools like Blender's Decimate modifier can help, but manual retopology often yields better results.\n3. Preserve silhouettes - The outline of your object is what the eye notices first at distance.\n4. Bake details to textures - Normal maps can maintain the illusion of detail on lower poly models.\n\n## Results\n\nFollowing this workflow, I've been able to reduce poly counts by 80% on LOD2 while maintaining 90% of the visual quality at typical viewing distances.",

Let me share how I organize and create these materials.\n\n## The Power of Smart Materials\n\nSmart materials react to mesh data like curvature, ambient occlusion, and world space position. This means they adapt automatically to new meshes.\n\n## Categories I Use\n\n- Metals - Steel, iron, copper, gold variations\n- Woods - Aged, painted, varnished, weathered\n- Fabrics - Leather, cloth, canvas\n- Wear & Damage - Edge wear, scratches, dirt\n\n## Tips for Creating Reusable Materials\n\n1. Use anchor points for flexibility\n2. Expose key parameters for easy customization\n3. Name layers clearly for future reference\n4. Test on multiple meshes before finalizing",

A weapon isn't just a weapon - it's a history of battles.",
